					Together we have progressed through the year, creating our little bot we named bean and growing together as a team.
					We faced many challenges, and also gained many rewards.
					In our first competition, We went into the semi finals. Although we didnt win, but for being a rookie team that's pretty good.
					At the competitions, we try to have everyone doing something, because everyone in the team is important.
					Throughout this past year, we have grown our team's working abilities, and our knowledge. 
					Even though some team members may have to leave, we will always remember our robotics expirence.
